# Premier_league

As a big premier league fan the focus is to learn of the facts from data and what it 
takes for your favorite team to win the title, avoid relegations or even qualify for the 
European champions

The excel project will tend to answer some of these questions, like for the last 20 years

   * Whats the highest points the champions have ever achieved
    
   * Whats the the least points the champions have ever earned
    
   * Are there outliers from the points ever eraned by the champions
    
   * And the same is for regelation battle

Relegation had a outlier, its interesting to learn that in the last 22 years the worst points ever achieved by a related team is 11 points.

Sheet2 of the excel has numerical analysis based on appearance for the last 22yrs, the regulars are few and has some interesting names,
it ranges from highest which is 22 to lowest which is just 1 appearance for the last 22 years.

The premier league has seen 44 teams grace it since 2000.
